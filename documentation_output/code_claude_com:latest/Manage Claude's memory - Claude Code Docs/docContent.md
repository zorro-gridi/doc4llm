Claude Code can remember your preferences across sessions, like style guidelines and common commands in your workflow.

## Determine memory type

Claude Code offers four memory locations in a hierarchical structure, each serving a different purpose:

Memory Type| Location| Purpose| Use Case Examples| Shared With  
---|---|---|---|---  
**Enterprise policy**|  • macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md`  
• Linux: `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`  
• Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\CLAUDE.md`| Organization-wide instructions managed by IT/DevOps| Company coding standards, security policies, compliance requirements| All users in organization  
**Project memory**| `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`| Team-shared instructions for the project| Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows| Team members via source control  
**Project rules**| `./.claude/rules/*.md`| Modular, topic-specific project instructions| Language-specific guidelines, testing conventions, API standards| Team members via source control  
**User memory**| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`| Personal preferences for all projects| Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts| Just you (all projects)  
**Project memory (local)**| `./CLAUDE.local.md`| Personal project-specific preferences| Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data| Just you (current project)  
  
All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code’s context when launched. Files higher in the hierarchy take precedence and are loaded first, providing a foundation that more specific memories build upon.

CLAUDE.local.md files are automatically added to .gitignore, making them ideal for private project-specific preferences that shouldn’t be checked into version control.

## CLAUDE.md imports

CLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:
    
    
    See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.
    
    # Additional Instructions
    - git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md
    

Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. In particular, importing files in user’s home dir is a convenient way for your team members to provide individual instructions that are not checked into the repository. Imports are an alternative to CLAUDE.local.md that work better across multiple git worktrees.
    
    
    # Individual Preferences
    - @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
    

To avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.


    
    
    This code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
    

Imported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.

## How Claude looks up memories

Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to (but not including) the root directory _/_ and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in _foo/bar/_ , and have memories in both _foo/CLAUDE.md_ and _foo/bar/CLAUDE.md_. Claude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.

## Directly edit memories with `/memory`

Use the `/memory` slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.

## Set up project memory

Suppose you want to set up a CLAUDE.md file to store important project information, conventions, and frequently used commands. Project memory can be stored in either `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Bootstrap a CLAUDE.md for your codebase with the following command:


    
    
    > /init
    

Tips:

  * Include frequently used commands (build, test, lint) to avoid repeated searches
  * Document code style preferences and naming conventions
  * Add important architectural patterns specific to your project
  * CLAUDE.md memories can be used for both instructions shared with your team and for your individual preferences.

## Modular rules with `.claude/rules/`

For larger projects, you can organize instructions into multiple files using the `.claude/rules/` directory. This allows teams to maintain focused, well-organized rule files instead of one large CLAUDE.md.

### Basic structure

Place markdown files in your project’s `.claude/rules/` directory:


    
    
    your-project/
    ├── .claude/
    │   ├── CLAUDE.md           # Main project instructions
    │   └── rules/
    │       ├── code-style.md   # Code style guidelines
    │       ├── testing.md      # Testing conventions
    │       └── security.md     # Security requirements
    

All `.md` files in `.claude/rules/` are automatically loaded as project memory, with the same priority as `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

### Path-specific rules

Rules can be scoped to specific files using YAML frontmatter with the `paths` field. These conditional rules only apply when Claude is working with files matching the specified patterns.


    
    
    ---
    paths:
      - "src/api/**/*.ts"
    ---
    
    # API Development Rules
    
    - All API endpoints must include input validation
    - Use the standard error response format
    - Include OpenAPI documentation comments
    

Rules without a `paths` field are loaded unconditionally and apply to all files.

### Glob patterns

The `paths` field supports standard glob patterns:

Pattern| Matches  
---|---  
`**/*.ts`| All TypeScript files in any directory  
`src/**/*`| All files under `src/` directory  
`*.md`| Markdown files in the project root  
`src/components/*.tsx`| React components in a specific directory  
  
You can specify multiple patterns:


    
    
    ---
    paths:
      - "src/**/*.ts"
      - "lib/**/*.ts"
      - "tests/**/*.test.ts"
    ---
    

Brace expansion is supported for matching multiple extensions or directories:


    
    
    ---
    paths:
      - "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
      - "{src,lib}/**/*.ts"
    ---
    
    # TypeScript/React Rules
    

This expands `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` to match both `.ts` and `.tsx` files.

### Subdirectories

Rules can be organized into subdirectories for better structure:


    
    
    .claude/rules/
    ├── frontend/
    │   ├── react.md
    │   └── styles.md
    ├── backend/
    │   ├── api.md
    │   └── database.md
    └── general.md
    

All `.md` files are discovered recursively.

### Symlinks

The `.claude/rules/` directory supports symlinks, allowing you to share common rules across multiple projects:


    
    
    # Symlink a shared rules directory
    ln -s ~/shared-claude-rules .claude/rules/shared
    
    # Symlink individual rule files
    ln -s ~/company-standards/security.md .claude/rules/security.md
    

Symlinks are resolved and their contents are loaded normally. Circular symlinks are detected and handled gracefully.

### User-level rules

You can create personal rules that apply to all your projects in `~/.claude/rules/`:


    
    
    ~/.claude/rules/
    ├── preferences.md    # Your personal coding preferences
    └── workflows.md      # Your preferred workflows
    

User-level rules are loaded before project rules, giving project rules higher priority.

Best practices for `.claude/rules/`:

  * **Keep rules focused** : Each file should cover one topic (e.g., `testing.md`, `api-design.md`)
  * **Use descriptive filenames** : The filename should indicate what the rules cover
  * **Use conditional rules sparingly** : Only add `paths` frontmatter when rules truly apply to specific file types
  * **Organize with subdirectories** : Group related rules (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/`)

## Organization-level memory management

Organizations can deploy centrally managed CLAUDE.md files that apply to all users. To set up organization-level memory management:

  1. Create the managed memory file at the **Managed policy** location shown in the memory types table above.
  2. Deploy via your configuration management system (MDM, Group Policy, Ansible, etc.) to ensure consistent distribution across all developer machines.

## Memory best practices

  * **Be specific** : “Use 2-space indentation” is better than “Format code properly”.
  * **Use structure to organize** : Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
  * **Review periodically** : Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.
