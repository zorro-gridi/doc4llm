## Legal agreements

### License

  * [Consumer Terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/consumer-terms) \- for Free, Pro, and Max users

### Commercial agreements

Whether you’re using the Claude API directly (1P) or accessing it through AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex (3P), your existing commercial agreement will apply to Claude Code usage, unless we’ve mutually agreed otherwise.

## Compliance

### Healthcare compliance (BAA)

If a customer has a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with us, and wants to use Claude Code, the BAA will automatically extend to cover Claude Code if the customer has executed a BAA and has Zero Data Retention (ZDR) activated. The BAA will be applicable to that customer’s API traffic flowing through Claude Code.
