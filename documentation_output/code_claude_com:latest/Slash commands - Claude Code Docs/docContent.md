## Custom slash commands

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.

Slash command autocomplete works anywhere in your input, not just at the beginning. Type `/` at any position to see available commands.

### Syntax
    
    
    /<command-name> [arguments]
    

#### Parameters

Parameter| Description  
---|---  
`<command-name>`| Name derived from the Markdown filename (without `.md` extension)  
`[arguments]`| Optional arguments passed to the command  
  
### Command types

#### Project commands

Commands stored in your repository and shared with your team. When listed in `/help`, these commands show “(project)” after their description. **Location** : `.claude/commands/` The following example creates the `/optimize` command:
    
    
    # Create a project command
    mkdir -p .claude/commands
    echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
    

#### Personal commands

Commands available across all your projects. When listed in `/help`, these commands show “(user)” after their description. **Location** : `~/.claude/commands/` The following example creates the `/security-review` command:


    
    
    # Create a personal command
    mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
    echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
    

### Features

#### Namespacing

Use subdirectories to group related commands. Subdirectories appear in the command description but don’t affect the command name. For example:

  * `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates `/component` with description “(project:frontend)”
  * `~/.claude/commands/component.md` creates `/component` with description “(user)”

If a project command and user command share the same name, the project command takes precedence and the user command is silently ignored. For example, if both `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and `~/.claude/commands/deploy.md` exist, `/deploy` runs the project version. Commands in different subdirectories can share names since the subdirectory appears in the description to distinguish them. For example, `.claude/commands/frontend/test.md` and `.claude/commands/backend/test.md` both create `/test`, but show as “(project:frontend)” and “(project:backend)” respectively.

#### Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using argument placeholders:

##### All arguments with `$ARGUMENTS`

The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder captures all arguments passed to the command:


    
    
    # Command definition
    echo 'Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards' > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md
    
    # Usage
    > /fix-issue 123 high-priority
    # $ARGUMENTS becomes: "123 high-priority"
    

##### Individual arguments with `$1`, `$2`, etc.

Access specific arguments individually using positional parameters (similar to shell scripts):


    
    
    # Command definition  
    echo 'Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3' > .claude/commands/review-pr.md
    
    # Usage
    > /review-pr 456 high alice
    # $1 becomes "456", $2 becomes "high", $3 becomes "alice"
    

Use positional arguments when you need to:

  * Access arguments individually in different parts of your command
  * Provide defaults for missing arguments
  * Build more structured commands with specific parameter roles

#### Bash command execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix. The output is included in the command context. You _must_ include `allowed-tools` with the `Bash` tool, but you can choose the specific bash commands to allow. For example:


    
    
    ---
    allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
    description: Create a git commit
    ---
    
    ## Context
    
    - Current git status: !`git status`
    - Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
    - Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
    - Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`
    
    ## Your task
    
    Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
    

#### File references

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix to [reference files](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows#reference-files-and-directories). For example:


    
    
    # Reference a specific file
    
    Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js
    
    # Reference multiple files
    
    Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
    

#### Thinking mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including [extended thinking keywords](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking).

### Frontmatter

Command files support frontmatter, useful for specifying metadata about the command:

Frontmatter| Purpose| Default  
---|---|---  
`allowed-tools`| List of tools the command can use| Inherits from the conversation  
`argument-hint`| The arguments expected for the slash command. Example: `argument-hint: add [tagId] | remove [tagId] | list`. This hint is shown to the user when auto-completing the slash command.| None  
`context`| Set to `fork` to run the command in a forked sub-agent context with its own conversation history.| Inline (no fork)  
`agent`| Specify which [agent type](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents#built-in-subagents) to use when `context: fork` is set. Only applicable when combined with `context: fork`.| `general-purpose`  
`description`| Brief description of the command| Uses the first line from the prompt  
`model`| Specific model string (see [Models overview](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview))| Inherits from the conversation  
`disable-model-invocation`| Whether to prevent the `Skill` tool from calling this command| false  
`hooks`| Define hooks scoped to this command’s execution. See Define hooks for commands.| None  
  
For example:


    
    
    ---
    allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
    argument-hint: [message]
    description: Create a git commit
    model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
    ---
    
    Create a git commit with message: $ARGUMENTS
    

Example using positional arguments:


    
    
    ---
    argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
    description: Review pull request
    ---
    
    Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3.
    Focus on security, performance, and code style.
    

#### Define hooks for commands

Slash commands can define hooks that run during the command’s execution. Use the `hooks` field to specify `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, or `Stop` handlers:


    
    
    ---
    description: Deploy to staging with validation
    hooks:
      PreToolUse:
        - matcher: "Bash"
          hooks:
            - type: command
              command: "./scripts/validate-deploy.sh"
              once: true
    ---
    
    Deploy the current branch to staging environment.
    

The `once: true` option runs the hook only once per session. After the first successful execution, the hook is removed. Hooks defined in a command are scoped to that command’s execution and are automatically cleaned up when the command finishes. See [Hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) for the complete hook configuration format.

## Plugin commands

[Plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) can provide custom slash commands that integrate seamlessly with Claude Code. Plugin commands work exactly like user-defined commands but are distributed through [plugin marketplaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).

### How plugin commands work

Plugin commands are:

  * **Namespaced** : Commands can use the format `/plugin-name:command-name` to avoid conflicts (plugin prefix is optional unless there are name collisions)
  * **Automatically available** : Once a plugin is installed and enabled, its commands appear in `/help`
  * **Fully integrated** : Support all command features (arguments, frontmatter, bash execution, file references)

### Plugin command structure

**Location** : `commands/` directory in plugin root **File format** : Markdown files with frontmatter **Basic command structure** :


    
    
    ---
    description: Brief description of what the command does
    ---
    
    # Command Name
    
    Detailed instructions for Claude on how to execute this command.
    Include specific guidance on parameters, expected outcomes, and any special considerations.
    

**Advanced command features** :

  * **Arguments** : Use placeholders like `{arg1}` in command descriptions
  * **Subdirectories** : Organize commands in subdirectories for namespacing
  * **Bash integration** : Commands can execute shell scripts and programs
  * **File references** : Commands can reference and modify project files

### Invocation patterns

Direct command (when no conflicts)


    
    
    /command-name
    

Plugin-prefixed (when needed for disambiguation)


    
    
    /plugin-name:command-name
    

With arguments (if command supports them)


    
    
    /command-name arg1 arg2
    

## MCP slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands that become available in Claude Code. These commands are dynamically discovered from connected MCP servers.

### Command format

MCP commands follow the pattern:


    
    
    /mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name> [arguments]
    

### Features

#### Dynamic discovery

MCP commands are automatically available when:

  * An MCP server is connected and active
  * The server exposes prompts through the MCP protocol
  * The prompts are successfully retrieved during connection

#### Arguments

MCP prompts can accept arguments defined by the server:


    
    
    # Without arguments
    > /mcp__github__list_prs
    
    # With arguments
    > /mcp__github__pr_review 456
    > /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug title" high
    

#### Naming conventions

Server and prompt names are normalized:

  * Spaces and special characters become underscores
  * Names are lowercase for consistency

### Managing MCP connections

Use the `/mcp` command to:

  * View all configured MCP servers
  * Check connection status
  * Authenticate with OAuth-enabled servers
  * Clear authentication tokens
  * View available tools and prompts from each server

### MCP permissions and wildcards

To approve all tools from an MCP server, use either the server name alone or wildcard syntax:

  * `mcp__github` (approves all GitHub tools)
  * `mcp__github__*` (wildcard syntax, also approves all GitHub tools)

To approve specific tools, list each one explicitly:

  * `mcp__github__get_issue`
  * `mcp__github__list_issues`

See [MCP permission rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules) for more details.

## `Skill` tool

In earlier versions of Claude Code, slash command invocation was provided by a separate `SlashCommand` tool. This has been merged into the `Skill` tool.

The `Skill` tool allows Claude to programmatically invoke both [custom slash commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands) and [Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) during a conversation. This gives Claude the ability to use these capabilities on your behalf when appropriate.

### What the `Skill` tool can invoke

The `Skill` tool provides access to:

Type| Location| Requirements  
---|---|---  
Custom slash commands| `.claude/commands/` or `~/.claude/commands/`| Must have `description` frontmatter  
Agent Skills| `.claude/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/`| Must not have `disable-model-invocation: true`  
  
Built-in commands like `/compact` and `/init` are _not_ available through this tool.

### Encourage Claude to use specific commands

To encourage Claude to use the `Skill` tool, reference the command by name, including the slash, in your prompts or `CLAUDE.md` file:


    
    
    > Run /write-unit-test when you are about to start writing tests.
    

This tool puts each available command’s metadata into context up to the character budget limit. Use `/context` to monitor token usage. To see which commands and Skills are available to the `Skill` tool, run `claude --debug` and trigger a query.

### Disable the `Skill` tool

To prevent Claude from programmatically invoking any commands or Skills:


    
    
    /permissions
    # Add to deny rules: Skill
    

This removes the `Skill` tool and all command/Skill descriptions from context.

### Disable specific commands or Skills

To prevent a specific command or Skill from being invoked programmatically via the `Skill` tool, add `disable-model-invocation: true` to its frontmatter. This also removes the item’s metadata from context.

The `user-invocable` field in Skills only controls menu visibility, not `Skill` tool access. Use `disable-model-invocation: true` to block programmatic invocation. See [Control Skill visibility](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#control-skill-visibility) for details.

### `Skill` permission rules

The permission rules support:

  * **Exact match** : `Skill(commit)` (allows only `commit` with no arguments)
  * **Prefix match** : `Skill(review-pr:*)` (allows `review-pr` with any arguments)

### Character budget limit

The `Skill` tool includes a character budget to limit context usage. This prevents token overflow when many commands and Skills are available. The budget includes each item’s name, arguments, and description.

  * **Default limit** : 15,000 characters
  * **Custom limit** : Set via `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable. The name is retained for backwards compatibility.

When the budget is exceeded, Claude sees only a subset of available items. In `/context`, a warning shows how many are included.

## Skills vs slash commands

**Slash commands** and **Agent Skills** serve different purposes in Claude Code:

### Use slash commands for

**Quick, frequently used prompts** :

  * Simple prompt snippets you use often
  * Quick reminders or templates
  * Frequently used instructions that fit in one file

**Examples** :

  * `/review` → “Review this code for bugs and suggest improvements”
  * `/explain` → “Explain this code in simple terms”
  * `/optimize` → “Analyze this code for performance issues”

### Use Skills for

**Comprehensive capabilities with structure** :

  * Complex workflows with multiple steps
  * Capabilities requiring scripts or utilities
  * Knowledge organized across multiple files
  * Team workflows you want to standardize

**Examples** :

  * PDF processing Skill with form-filling scripts and validation
  * Data analysis Skill with reference docs for different data types
  * Documentation Skill with style guides and templates

### Key differences

Aspect| Slash Commands| Agent Skills  
---|---|---  
**Complexity**|  Simple prompts| Complex capabilities  
**Structure**|  Single .md file| Directory with SKILL.md + resources  
**Discovery**|  Explicit invocation (`/command`)| Automatic (based on context)  
**Files**|  One file only| Multiple files, scripts, templates  
**Scope**|  Project or personal| Project or personal  
**Sharing**|  Via git| Via git  
  
### Example comparison

**As a slash command** :


    
    
    # .claude/commands/review.md
    Review this code for:
    - Security vulnerabilities
    - Performance issues
    - Code style violations
    

Usage: `/review` (manual invocation) **As a Skill** :


    
    
    .claude/skills/code-review/
    ├── SKILL.md (overview and workflows)
    ├── SECURITY.md (security checklist)
    ├── PERFORMANCE.md (performance patterns)
    ├── STYLE.md (style guide reference)
    └── scripts/
        └── run-linters.sh
    

Usage: “Can you review this code?” (automatic discovery) The Skill provides richer context, validation scripts, and organized reference material.

### When to use each

**Use slash commands** :

  * You invoke the same prompt repeatedly
  * The prompt fits in a single file
  * You want explicit control over when it runs

**Use Skills** :

  * Claude should discover the capability automatically
  * Multiple files or scripts are needed
  * Complex workflows with validation steps
  * Team needs standardized, detailed guidance

Both slash commands and Skills can coexist. Use the approach that fits your needs. Learn more about [Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).
