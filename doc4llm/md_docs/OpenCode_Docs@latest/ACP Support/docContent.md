# ACP Support

Use OpenCode in any ACP-compatible editor.

OpenCode supports the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) or (ACP), allowing you to use it directly in compatible editors and IDEs.

ACP is an open protocol that standardizes communication between code editors and AI coding agents.

* * *

## Configure

To use OpenCode via ACP, configure your editor to run the `opencode acp` command.

The command starts OpenCode as an ACP-compatible subprocess that communicates with your editor over JSON-RPC via stdio.

Below are examples for popular editors that support ACP.

### Zed

Add to your [Zed](https://zed.dev) configuration (`~/.config/zed/settings.json`):

~/.config/zed/settings.json
    
    {
    
      "agent_servers": {
    
        "OpenCode": {
    
          "command": "opencode",
    
          "args": ["acp"]
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

To open it, use the `agent: new thread` action in the **Command Palette**.

You can also bind a keyboard shortcut by editing your `keymap.json`:

keymap.json
    
    [
    
      {
    
        "bindings": {
    
          "cmd-alt-o": [
    
            "agent::NewExternalAgentThread",
    
            {
    
              "agent": {
    
                "custom": {
    
                  "name": "OpenCode",
    
                  "command": {
    
                    "command": "opencode",
    
                    "args": ["acp"]
    
                  }
    
                }
    
              }
    
            }
    
          ]
    
        }
    
      }
    
    ]

* * *

### JetBrains IDEs

Add to your [JetBrains IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/) acp.json according to the [documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/acp.html):

acp.json
    
    {
    
      "agent_servers": {
    
        "OpenCode": {
    
          "command": "/absolute/path/bin/opencode",
    
          "args": ["acp"]
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

To open it, use the new ‘OpenCode’ agent in the AI Chat agent selector.

* * *

### Avante.nvim

Add to your [Avante.nvim](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim) configuration:
    
    {
    
      acp_providers = {
    
        ["opencode"] = {
    
          command = "opencode",
    
          args = { "acp" }
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

If you need to pass environment variables:
    
    {
    
      acp_providers = {
    
        ["opencode"] = {
    
          command = "opencode",
    
          args = { "acp" },
    
          env = {
    
            OPENCODE_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENCODE_API_KEY")
    
          }
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

* * *

### CodeCompanion.nvim

To use OpenCode as an ACP agent in [CodeCompanion.nvim](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim), add the following to your Neovim config:
    
    require("codecompanion").setup({
    
      interactions = {
    
        chat = {
    
          adapter = {
    
            name = "opencode",
    
            model = "claude-sonnet-4",
    
          },
    
        },
    
      },
    
    })

This config sets up CodeCompanion to use OpenCode as the ACP agent for chat.

If you need to pass environment variables (like `OPENCODE_API_KEY`), refer to [Configuring Adapters: Environment Variables](https://codecompanion.olimorris.dev/getting-started#setting-an-api-key) in the CodeCompanion.nvim documentation for full details.

## Support

OpenCode works the same via ACP as it does in the terminal. All features are supported:

     * Built-in tools (file operations, terminal commands, etc.)
     * Custom tools and slash commands
     * MCP servers configured in your OpenCode config
     * Project-specific rules from `AGENTS.md`
     * Custom formatters and linters
     * Agents and permissions system
