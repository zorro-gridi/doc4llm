# Commands

Create custom commands for repetitive tasks.

Custom commands let you specify a prompt you want to run when that command is executed in the TUI.
    
    /my-command

Custom commands are in addition to the built-in commands like `/init`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/share`, `/help`. [Learn more](https://opencode.ai/docs/tui#commands).

* * *

## Create command files

Create markdown files in the `commands/` directory to define custom commands.

Create `.opencode/commands/test.md`:

.opencode/commands/test.md
    
    ---
    
    description: Run tests with coverage
    
    agent: build
    
    model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
    
    ---
    
    
    
    
    Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.
    
    Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.

The frontmatter defines command properties. The content becomes the template.

Use the command by typing `/` followed by the command name.
    
    "/test"

* * *

## Configure

You can add custom commands through the OpenCode config or by creating markdown files in the `commands/` directory.

* * *

### JSON

Use the `command` option in your OpenCode [config](https://opencode.ai/docs/config):

opencode.jsonc
    
    {
    
      "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
    
      "command": {
    
        // This becomes the name of the command
    
        "test": {
    
          // This is the prompt that will be sent to the LLM
    
          "template": "Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.\nFocus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.",
    
          // This is shown as the description in the TUI
    
          "description": "Run tests with coverage",
    
          "agent": "build",
    
          "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

Now you can run this command in the TUI:
    
    /test

* * *

### Markdown

You can also define commands using markdown files. Place them in:

     * Global: `~/.config/opencode/commands/`
     * Per-project: `.opencode/commands/`

~/.config/opencode/commands/test.md
    
    ---
    
    description: Run tests with coverage
    
    agent: build
    
    model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
    
    ---
    
    
    
    
    Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.
    
    Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.

The markdown file name becomes the command name. For example, `test.md` lets you run:
    
    /test

* * *

## Prompt config

The prompts for the custom commands support several special placeholders and syntax.

* * *

### Arguments

Pass arguments to commands using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

.opencode/commands/component.md
    
    ---
    
    description: Create a new component
    
    ---
    
    
    
    
    Create a new React component named $ARGUMENTS with TypeScript support.
    
    Include proper typing and basic structure.

Run the command with arguments:
    
    /component Button

And `$ARGUMENTS` will be replaced with `Button`.

You can also access individual arguments using positional parameters:

     * `$1` - First argument
     * `$2` - Second argument
     * `$3` - Third argument
     * And so on…

For example:

.opencode/commands/create-file.md
    
    ---
    
    description: Create a new file with content
    
    ---
    
    
    
    
    Create a file named $1 in the directory $2
    
    with the following content: $3

Run the command:
    
    /create-file config.json src "{ \"key\": \"value\" }"

This replaces:

     * `$1` with `config.json`
     * `$2` with `src`
     * `$3` with `{ "key": "value" }`

* * *

### Shell output

Use _!`command`_ to inject [bash command](https://opencode.ai/docs/tui#bash-commands) output into your prompt.

For example, to create a custom command that analyzes test coverage:

.opencode/commands/analyze-coverage.md
    
    ---
    
    description: Analyze test coverage
    
    ---
    
    
    
    
    Here are the current test results:
    
    !`npm test`
    
    
    
    
    Based on these results, suggest improvements to increase coverage.

Or to review recent changes:

.opencode/commands/review-changes.md
    
    ---
    
    description: Review recent changes
    
    ---
    
    
    
    
    Recent git commits:
    
    !`git log --oneline -10`
    
    
    
    
    Review these changes and suggest any improvements.

Commands run in your project’s root directory and their output becomes part of the prompt.

* * *

### File references

Include files in your command using `@` followed by the filename.

.opencode/commands/review-component.md
    
    ---
    
    description: Review component
    
    ---
    
    
    
    
    Review the component in @src/components/Button.tsx.
    
    Check for performance issues and suggest improvements.

The file content gets included in the prompt automatically.

* * *

## Options

Let’s look at the configuration options in detail.

* * *

### Template

The `template` option defines the prompt that will be sent to the LLM when the command is executed.

opencode.json
    
    {
    
      "command": {
    
        "test": {
    
          "template": "Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.\nFocus on the failing tests and suggest fixes."
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

This is a **required** config option.

* * *

### Description

Use the `description` option to provide a brief description of what the command does.

opencode.json
    
    {
    
      "command": {
    
        "test": {
    
          "description": "Run tests with coverage"
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

This is shown as the description in the TUI when you type in the command.

* * *

### Agent

Use the `agent` config to optionally specify which [agent](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents) should execute this command. If this is a [subagent](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/#subagents) the command will trigger a subagent invocation by default. To disable this behavior, set `subtask` to `false`.

opencode.json
    
    {
    
      "command": {
    
        "review": {
    
          "agent": "plan"
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

This is an **optional** config option. If not specified, defaults to your current agent.

* * *

### Subtask

Use the `subtask` boolean to force the command to trigger a [subagent](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/#subagents) invocation. This is useful if you want the command to not pollute your primary context and will **force** the agent to act as a subagent, even if `mode` is set to `primary` on the [agent](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents) configuration.

opencode.json
    
    {
    
      "command": {
    
        "analyze": {
    
          "subtask": true
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

This is an **optional** config option.

* * *

### Model

Use the `model` config to override the default model for this command.

opencode.json
    
    {
    
      "command": {
    
        "analyze": {
    
          "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

This is an **optional** config option.

* * *

## Built-in

opencode includes several built-in commands like `/init`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/share`, `/help`; [learn more](https://opencode.ai/docs/tui#commands).

If you define a custom command with the same name, it will override the built-in command.
