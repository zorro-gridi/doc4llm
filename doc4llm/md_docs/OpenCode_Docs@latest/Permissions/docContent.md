# Permissions

Control which actions require approval to run.

OpenCode uses the `permission` config to decide whether a given action should run automatically, prompt you, or be blocked.

As of `v1.1.1`, the legacy `tools` boolean config is deprecated and has been merged into `permission`. The old `tools` config is still supported for backwards compatibility.

* * *

## Actions

Each permission rule resolves to one of:

     * `"allow"` — run without approval
     * `"ask"` — prompt for approval
     * `"deny"` — block the action

* * *

## Configuration

You can set permissions globally (with `*`), and override specific tools.

opencode.json
    
    {
    
      "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
    
      "permission": {
    
        "*": "ask",
    
        "bash": "allow",
    
        "edit": "deny"
    
      }
    
    }

You can also set all permissions at once:

opencode.json
    
    {
    
      "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
    
      "permission": "allow"
    
    }

* * *

## Granular Rules (Object Syntax)

For most permissions, you can use an object to apply different actions based on the tool input.

opencode.json
    
    {
    
      "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
    
      "permission": {
    
        "bash": {
    
          "*": "ask",
    
          "git *": "allow",
    
          "npm *": "allow",
    
          "rm *": "deny",
    
          "grep *": "allow"
    
        },
    
        "edit": {
    
          "*": "deny",
    
          "packages/web/src/content/docs/*.mdx": "allow"
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

Rules are evaluated by pattern match, with the **last matching rule winning**. A common pattern is to put the catch-all `"*"` rule first, and more specific rules after it.

### Wildcards

Permission patterns use simple wildcard matching:

     * `*` matches zero or more of any character
     * `?` matches exactly one character
     * All other characters match literally

### Home Directory Expansion

You can use `~` or `$HOME` at the start of a pattern to reference your home directory. This is particularly useful for `external_directory` rules.

     * `~/projects/*` -> `/Users/username/projects/*`
     * `$HOME/projects/*` -> `/Users/username/projects/*`
     * `~` -> `/Users/username`

* * *

## Available Permissions

OpenCode permissions are keyed by tool name, plus a couple of safety guards:

     * `read` — reading a file (matches the file path)
     * `edit` — all file modifications (covers `edit`, `write`, `patch`, `multiedit`)
     * `glob` — file globbing (matches the glob pattern)
     * `grep` — content search (matches the regex pattern)
     * `list` — listing files in a directory (matches the directory path)
     * `bash` — running shell commands (matches parsed commands like `git status --porcelain`)
     * `task` — launching subagents (matches the subagent type)
     * `skill` — loading a skill (matches the skill name)
     * `lsp` — running LSP queries (currently non-granular)
     * `todoread`, `todowrite` — reading/updating the todo list
     * `webfetch` — fetching a URL (matches the URL)
     * `websearch`, `codesearch` — web/code search (matches the query)
     * `external_directory` — triggered when a tool touches paths outside the project working directory
     * `doom_loop` — triggered when the same tool call repeats 3 times with identical input

* * *

## Defaults

If you don’t specify anything, OpenCode starts from permissive defaults:

     * Most permissions default to `"allow"`.
     * `doom_loop` and `external_directory` default to `"ask"`.
     * `read` is `"allow"`, but `.env` files are denied by default:

opencode.json
    
    {
    
      "permission": {
    
        "read": {
    
          "*": "allow",
    
          "*.env": "deny",
    
          "*.env.*": "deny",
    
          "*.env.example": "allow"
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

* * *

## What “Ask” Does

When OpenCode prompts for approval, the UI offers three outcomes:

     * `once` — approve just this request
     * `always` — approve future requests matching the suggested patterns (for the rest of the current OpenCode session)
     * `reject` — deny the request

The set of patterns that `always` would approve is provided by the tool (for example, bash approvals typically whitelist a safe command prefix like `git status*`).

## Agents

You can override permissions per agent. Agent permissions are merged with the global config, and agent rules take precedence. [Learn more](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents#permissions) about agent permissions.

opencode.json
    
    {
    
      "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
    
      "permission": {
    
        "bash": {
    
          "*": "ask",
    
          "git *": "allow",
    
          "git commit *": "deny",
    
          "git push *": "deny",
    
          "grep *": "allow"
    
        }
    
      },
    
      "agent": {
    
        "build": {
    
          "permission": {
    
            "bash": {
    
              "*": "ask",
    
              "git *": "allow",
    
              "git commit *": "ask",
    
              "git push *": "deny",
    
              "grep *": "allow"
    
            }
    
          }
    
        }
    
      }
    
    }

You can also configure agent permissions in Markdown:

~/.config/opencode/agents/review.md
    
    ---
    
    description: Code review without edits
    
    mode: subagent
    
    permission:
    
      edit: deny
    
      bash: ask
    
      webfetch: deny
    
    ---
    
    
    
    
    Only analyze code and suggest changes.
